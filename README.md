hangman game

save hangman.py and words.txt to folder
run from cmd line from saved folder -> hangman.py

words.txt is a bank of words from which the program chooses the secret word to guess in the game.
you can change the words in the txt file or use a different txt file altogether.
words have to be letters only and seperated by one space

The program will require to insert the file path to the txt file
i.e. c:\my_folder\some_words.txt
